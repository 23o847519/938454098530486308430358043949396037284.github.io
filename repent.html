	<h1>Lyrics: Open to Me the Gates of Repentance</h1>
	<p>Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit</p>
	<p>Open to me the gates of repentence, O giver of life</p>
	<p>For my spirit goeth early, to the temple of Thy holiness</p>
	<p>Coming in the temple of my body, wholly polluted</p>
	<p>But beacuse thou art compassionate purify Thou me, by the the compassion, of Thy mercy</p>
	<p>Both now and ever unto ages of ages.Amen.</p>	
	<p>Guide me in the paths of salvation, O Yahweh</p>
	<p>For I have profaned myself with course sins, and consumed my whole life with procrastination</p>
	<p>But by thine intercessions, purify thou me from all abominations</p>
	<p>Have mercy on me, O Yahweh, according to thine loving kindness and according to the multitude of thy tender mercies</p>
	<p>Blot out my transgressions</p>
	<p>as a ponder in my wretcheness the many evil things I have done</p>
	<p>I TREMBLE for the fearful day of judegement</p>
	<p>But trusting in Thy meriful compassion like David do I cry out to Thee</p>
	<p>Have mercy apoun me,O Yahweh, in thy great mercy</p>

	<h1>Say this prayer while still on your knees</h1>
	<h1> Psalm 51 NKJV </h1>	
	<p>Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness:</p> 
	<p>according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions</p>
	<p>Wash me throughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.</p>
	<p>For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin is ever before me.</p>
	<p>Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight: that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest, and be clear when thou judgest.</p>
	<p>Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me.</p>
	<p>Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts: and in the hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisdom.</p>
	<p>Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.</p>
	<p>Make me to hear joy and gladness; that the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice.</p>
	<p>Hide thy face from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities.</p>
	<p>Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me.</p>
	<p>Cast me not away from thy presence; and take not thy holy spirit from me.</p>
	<p>Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation; and uphold me with thy free spirit.</p>
	<p>Then will I teach transgressors thy ways; and sinners shall be converted unto thee.</p>
	<p>Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, thou God of my salvation: and my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness.</p>
	<p>O Lord, open thou my lips; and my mouth shall shew forth thy praise.</p>
	<p>For thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give it: thou delightest not in burnt offering.</p>
	<p>The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.</p>
	<p>Do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion: build thou the walls of Jerusalem.</p>
	<p>Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness, with burnt offering and whole burnt offering: then shall they offer bullocks 	upon thine altar.</p>
