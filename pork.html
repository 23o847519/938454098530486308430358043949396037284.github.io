<h1>Why Christians(maybe)Should Not Eat Pork</h1>

</center>


<a>(im not going to center bible verses its so annoying to read)</a>
<h1>Matthew 15</h1>
<p>Then come unto Jesus do they from Jerusalem -- scribes and Pharisees -- saying,</p>
<p>2 `Wherefore do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they do not wash their hands when they may eat bread.'</p>
<a>(2First instance were they mention this passage is about not washing hands before eating)</a>
<p>3 And he answering said to them, `Wherefore also do ye transgress the command of God because of your tradition?</p>
<p>4 for God did command, saying, Honour thy father and mother; and, He who is speaking evil of father or mother -- let him die the death;</p>
<p>5 but ye say, Whoever may say to father or mother, An offering [is] whatever thou mayest be profited by me; --</p>
<p>6 and he may not honour his father or his mother, and ye did set aside the command of God because of your tradition.</p>
<p>7 `Hypocrites, well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying,</p>
<p>8 This people doth draw nigh to Me with their mouth, and with the lips it doth honour Me, but their heart is far off from Me;</p>
<p>9 and in vain do they worship Me, teaching teachings -- commands of men.'</p>
<p>10 And having called near the multitude, he said to them, `Hear and understand:</p>
<p>11 not that which is coming into the mouth doth defile the man, but that which is coming forth from the mouth, this defileth the man.'</p>
<a>(Yahshua[Jesus]states (11) the the food or matter going into you in itself does not defile you but the act of willingly violting the Torah does)</a>
<p>12 Then his disciples having come near, said to him, `Hast thou known that the Pharisees, having heard the word, were stumbled?'</p>
<p>13 And he answering said, `Every plant that my heavenly Father did not plant shall be rooted up;</p>
<p>14 let them alone, guides they are -- blind of blind; and if blind may guide blind, both into a ditch shall fall.'</p>
<p>15 And Peter answering said to him, `Explain to us this simile.'</p>
<p>16 And Jesus said, `Are ye also yet without understanding?</p>
<p>17 do ye not understand that all that is going into the mouth doth pass into the belly, and into the drain is cast forth?</p>
<p>18 but the things coming forth from the mouth from the heart do come forth, and these defile the man;</p>
<p>19 for out of the heart come forth evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, whoredoms, thefts, false witnessings, evil speakings:</p>
<a>(here Yeshua again (19) confirms that what defiles you comes from the heart like violating the Torah. The pig does not defile you when you touch or eat it but you defile yourself by touching what god has deemed unclean for us)</a>
<p>20 these are the things defiling the man; but to eat with unwashen hands doth not defile the man.'</p>
<a>(again Yeshua states this whole interaction with the Pharisees is in the context of the man made tradishion about washing hands see: 2,3,6)</a>
<a>This is not the end of Matthew:15 but I put in everything relvent for now</a>
<a>The Pharisees were already out to get him. Yahshua certainly didn't speak against his father's word. If he had; the Pharisees would have had him right where they wanted him; and he would not have been who he claimed to be. See Deuteronomy 13.</a>
<h1>Matthew 5</h1>
<p>17 `Do not suppose that I came to throw down the law or the prophets -- I did not come to throw down, but to fulfill;</p>
<a>(Did Jesus fullfill the kosher law? who knows..)</a>
<p>18 for, verily I say to you, till that the heaven and the earth may pass away, one iota or one tittle may not pass away from the law, till that all may come to pass.</p>
<a>("till that all may come to pass" what does this mean?)</a>
<p>19 `Whoever therefore may loose one of these commands -- the least -- and may teach men so, least he shall be called in the reign of the heavens, but whoever may do and may teach [them], he shall be called great in the reign of the heavens.</p>
<a>All was accomplished when the Lord said "it is finished" on the Cross. But to me the Law being fulfilled does not bring an end to it, I think Christians do indeed keep it, just in a way befitting Christians. To me it means something more like "transformed." For instance in the Eucharist and priesthood and "make living sacrifices of yourselves" we keep the Laws concerning priesthood and Sacrifice. The same for all the rest. </a>
<a>it is up to interpritation wether or not we have to follow the Torah but I still think pork is gross just imagine a pigs face next time you eat pork...</a>
