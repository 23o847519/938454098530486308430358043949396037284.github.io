<h1> Vtubers Anime Girls And Lonliness</h1>
<h2>A comprehensive talk on how fictionial characters can be unhealthy</h2>

<h1> How does it start?</h1>
<a>It is not a coinsidence most of the people who get obsessed with anime are loners and unhealthy. There is a community of people that chase degeneracy on the internet. It is like a think tank that rewards you with praise the more time you spend obessing over vtubers the more times you masturbated the more you collect the more you watched and the more you read. The worse the more unhealthy and obessive it becomes the more praise you get. Its like how (some) drug addicts (mostly young retarded teens) think that last 1 week adderall bringe is "cool" or how partying and damaging their body is "cool" ofcourse not all are like this this post is targeting young lonley teens I am talking about a specific group of people I know exists.</a>

<h1> How (most) Vtubers take advantage of a epidemic of loneliness </h1>
<p>Most vtubers are demons that only want your money. Examples are vtubes like veibae senchou marine. They will take advantage of people that already have a porn addiction make it worse then milk them for money.</p>
