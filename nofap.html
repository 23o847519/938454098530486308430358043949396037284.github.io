<h1> Vtubers Anime Girls And Lonliness</h1>
<h2>A comprehensive talk on how fictionial characters can be unhealthy</h2>
<h1> This is a work in progress post and will take a long time to finish</h1>
<h1> How does it start?</h1>
<a>It is not a coinsidence most of the people who get obsessed with anime are loners and unhealthy. There is a community of people that chase degeneracy on the internet. It is like a think tank that rewards you with praise the more time you spend obessing over vtubers the more times you masturbated the more you collect the more you watched and the more you read. The worse the more unhealthy and obessive it becomes the more praise you get. Its like how (some) drug addicts (mostly young retarded teens) think that last 1 week adderall bringe is "cool" or how partying and damaging their body is "cool" ofcourse not all are like this this post is targeting young lonley teens I am talking about a specific group of people I know exists. Young lonley teen men can get sucked into this community. </a>

<h1> Why it is unhealthy </h1>
<a> This kind of addiction will always lead to physical mental and spiritual depravity. Men will spend less time with real people men will sexualize woman to the point everytime they see real and fake girls they can only think of sex. This can take over every part of a mans life.</a>

<h1> I got tired about writing about this TLDR vtubers are cringe and will milk you for money and make you as loser</h1>
