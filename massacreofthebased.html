The Great Massacre Of The Based, also known as the Rule 10 Campaign was a major SillySeeker mod offensive on the Rebuild of Silly Seeker's Server.

The mods achieved a total surprise attack on Febuary 9th 2022 around 6:27 US EST by accouncing a new rule, "10. Don't message hate speech. (Racism, anti-Semitism,etc.)" 
as you can see this is literally 1984.
